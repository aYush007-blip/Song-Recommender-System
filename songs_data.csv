Justin Bieber,All Bad,"[Verse:]  
It's another, if it ain't one thing  
Instigators, like pouring fire on propane  
The wrong thing, they be worried about  
Ooh, you know females  
And how they like to run their mouths  
  
Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you  
(like you) you (like you)  
Misery, misery, best company  
Don't let them change your mood  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Between us, they wanna comment  
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend  
Perfect, ain't saying that I am  
Proven, it's proven I don't give a damn  
  
Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)  
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy  
Jealous of you  
That's what they do  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad

Justin Bieber,All I Want Is You,"Sitting here all alone watching the snow fall  
Looking back at the days when we threw them snowballs  
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself  
I need you and nobody else  
I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
And I never wanna do this alone  
Baby I just need you to be here  
Here through the holidays, yeah  
I just wanna know if you feel the same way  
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby  
  
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
I just want you to know I miss you  
And I want you to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas

Wrapping gifts without you baby  
Is like mid December and there's no cold  
I can't do this on my own (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
I've changed my ways  
We keep running back and forth again  
I'm here to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas

Justin Bieber,As Long As You Love Me,"As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me  
  
We're under pressure,  
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in  
Keep it together,  
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning  
But hey now, you know girl,  
We both know it's a cruel world  
But I will take my chances  
  
As long as you love me  
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
  
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl  
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a scene girl  
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly  
Just take my hand  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
As long as you love, love me,  
  
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah  
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,  
I'll beat ya there  
Girl you know I got you  
Us, trust  
A couple of things I can't spell without you  
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do  
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view  
Man now we stepping out like whoa (oh God)  
Camera's point and shoot,  
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you  
You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,  
It's green where you water it  
So I know we got issues baby true true true  
But I'd rather work on this with you  
Than to go ahead and start with someone new  
As long as you love me  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me,  
As long as you love, love me  
  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
Love me,  
As long as you love, love me,  
Please don't go (love me, love me)  
Please don't go (love me, love me)  
As long as you love, (love me, love me)  
As long as you love, (love me, love me)

Justin Bieber,Baby Lady,"Put me in a outfit from the gap like that. One that  
Matches  
With the jacket and the cap like that.  
Then slap me in the stroller with the bounce like that.  
With the bottle full of milk that's 40 ounce like that.  
I'm your b-baby lady.  
Tina - I wanna push you in the buggy.  
I'm your b-baby lady,  
I wanna hold you like a Snuggie.  
You're my baby, lady.

Justin Bieber,Been You,"[Verse 1]  
Feeling the reminisce  
Gone in an instance  
Blink of an eye  
No goodbye  
I had a notion  
Deep as the ocean  
Blue like the sky  
Oh my  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
But we're the blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
(Woah, woah, woah)  
If I had the chance  
If I had the chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Verse 2]  
There repercussion  
Of missing your loving  
Haunts me at night  
The ghosts are alive  
All of the memories  
Of serenity  
Dwindle in my mind  
All the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
Who was to blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you

Justin Bieber,Cry Me A Heartless Swag On The River One Time,"How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
You were my sun  
You were my earth  
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no  
  
You know why?  
Cause in the night, I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
That's why I said,  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said ""what's up?""  
Yeah, I'm gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh  
  
I want the money, money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful, yeah, said  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Justin Bieber,Down To Earth,"Oh, oh, oh  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how  
No one has a solid answer  
Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's up to you and it's up to me  
That we meet in the middle  
On our way back down to earth  
Down to earth, down to earth  
On our way back down to earth  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
  
Mommy you were always somewhere  
And Daddy I live outta town  
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how  
You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We fell so far away from where we used to be  
Now we're standing, and where do we go  
When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how.

At the table with the family,  
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,  
Then it gave a lil' flicker then  
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,  
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,  
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,  
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,  
I said cool, cool,  
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger,  
Before we work I gotta get this off,  
See the other family members and drop gifts off,  
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,  
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,

It's about time for you to act merrily,  
It's about time for you give to charity,  
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,  
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,  
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,  
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,  
So I think some of you need to act bold,  
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,

About a girl and a boy

But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I don't wanna lose it either  
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe

Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

Justin Bieber,Forever,"I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
Girl it's getting late, the sun's going down  
And it's about the time to shake my cross the town  
But before I go, I just wanna say  
That you stay on my mind each and everyday  
  
I think I'm starting to like  
The time that we spend  
And it's building inside  
Then I can't pretend  
  
No I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel  
So I guess it's time for me to say  
That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
Don't know if is love, it's too early to say  
But if it's something like it I just want it to remain  
Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time  
But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine  
Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before  
And if it's a hint of what's to come then maybe can I get some more?  
  
Not trying to be too forward, but I think it's best for you to know  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this

Justin Bieber,Get Used To Me,"[Verse 1]  
Subjected to my system  
Reflecting on the days  
When we used to be just friends  
Protected both our interest  
Our trust was in a bank  
That's where our hearts were safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And then we got closer  
Separated from my ex  
Til we got closure  
Oh, in every visit  
Feelings got stronger  
Now this is out our hands  
Our love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I'm a April shower you  
Forever if I May  
'Til your flowers bloom in June  
Make sure that our fireworks  
Be your 4th of July  
For life  
As long as you stand right by my side  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Keep growing closer  
Throughout October  
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve  
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve  
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face

Justin Bieber,Girlfriend,"Since the first day I met her I knew she was the one  
Or  
I know she's the one I've been searching for all my life  
Or  
There's not a day that I could go without her, I have to see her beautiful
face  
Or  
Every time I'm with her I fell like if I'm dreaming  
Or  
I just can't stop thinking about her  
Or  
I love everything about her, there's not one thing that I'll ever change about
her  
Or  
There's something about her that makes me fall in love with her within
everyday  
Or  
It's like a dream come true, I still can't believe how a pretty lady like her
fell in love with me  
Or  
She's the best girlfriend I've had so far  
Well that's all I got for now!

And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand  
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man  
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around  
But, this is, this is personal, this is, for me and you  
And I want you to know that I still love you  
And I know the seasons may change  
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain  
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name  
And you know I don't wanna lose that  
  
(I still believe)  
I still believe in love  
I still believe in us  
I hope you believe in us  
The way I believe in us  
  
You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak  
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya  
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your baby jeans  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart  
Be careful with your heart

"
Justin Bieber,I Am Your Man,"I always see the girls walk past me  
But they really don't know what I'm like  
I'm funny, talented and stupid  
I hate boys because they try to take my women  
They get on my nerves so I start pokin  
  
So I keep on saying  
I can't stand guys  
They have ugly eyes  
They smell like cats  
And are fats  
They are so stupid  
They act like cupid  
But they don't know I I am your man  
Ha  
(Your man)  
Lalalala

You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up

And we fought to pass the time  
And I realized, I realized, that we

My life is a movie and everyone's watching  
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way  
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real

"
Justin Bieber,Life Is Worth Living,"Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it ain't over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
  
Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin' down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent us an angel to help us out  
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't ever over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
Life is worth living again  
  
What I'd give for my affection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I ain't perfect, won't deny  
My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again

To think that you're the one for me

Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
People try to tell me  
But I still refuse to listen  
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you  
A minute with you is worth more than  
A thousand days without your love, oh your love  
  
Oh, baby you can do no wrong  
My money is yours  
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya  
With me, girl, is where you belong  
Just stay right here  
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
My heart is blind but I don't care  
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared  
And every time I hold you near  
I never wanna let you go, oh  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me

Justin Bieber,Mama's Boy,"Walkin on red dirt no concrete pavement  
Navy blue book bag on my back  
  
Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station  
Hope they let me ride away with them  
  
Got pretty mad at my father today  
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say  
  
As I'm singin an old song she used to sing  
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
So I turn around and headed to the old run down building  
Bells gonna ring before I make it back  
  
I watch the upper class men drive right past me  
Wish they'd let me ride away with them  
  
Still haven't got over it yet  
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear  
  
My ipods the same tune my mother would sing  
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
Never get mad enough to walk out  
If I do then I won't be gone for long  
  
Never fed up enough to leave her  
No matter what I'll love her just the same  
  
That's my mama  
Yeah  
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away  
Run away, yeah  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't

Justin Bieber,Never Say Never,"Never say never (never never never)  
  
You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)  
I never thought that I could take the burn  
I never had the strength to take it higher  
Until I reach the point of no return  
  
And there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
Never say it, never, never say it  
  
I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)  
I never thought that I could feel this free  
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)  
  
'Cause there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
'Cause this is my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Here we go  
Guess who?  
J-Smith and J-B!  
I gotcha lil' bro  
I can handle him  
Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Never say never  
  
I will never say never (never say never)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
  
And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
(Ne-never say never, never say it)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
And never say never

Missing your good intentions

We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us

Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall  
All about money tied in a know stand over there  
That's why I make it happen on blocks  
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather  
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta

When you meet the parents you tell De Niro  
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo  
Next show they gotta up the zeroes  
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old  
  
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me  
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me  
The young youth rocking the gold tooth  
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules  
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'

No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss

Justin Bieber,Slave To The Rhythm,"[Verse:]  
She dances in the sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances 'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep...  
  
She dances at the break of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She can't be late, can't take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
  
She dances for the men at work  
Who works her all the time  
She can't be rude as she says so  
""I must be home tonight""  
  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
She sets his food an hour late  
She must be out of her mind...  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She works so hard, just to make her way  
For a man who just won't appreciate  
  
And don't know it takes  
And was all in vain.  
Still she could not stop,  
Couldn't break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore she'd dance no more  
But then she did, she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home, home  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love

Justin Bieber,So Sick,"Mmmm mmm yeah  
Do do do do do do do-do  
Ohh Yeah  
  
Gotta change my answering machine  
Now that I'm alone  
Cuz right now it says that we  
Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
Cuz you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
It's ridiculous  
It's been months  
And for some reason I just  
Can't get over us  
And I'm stronger than this  
Enough is enough  
No more walkin round  
With my head down  
I'm so over being blue  
Cryin over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
I'm letting go  
Turning off the radio  
  
Cuz I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishin' you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?

Justin Bieber,Stuck In The Moment,"With you,  
With you,  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place  
  
Now Romeo and Juliet,  
Bet they never felt the way we felt,  
Bonnie and Clyde,  
Never had to hide like,  
We do,  
We do  
  
You and I both know it can't work,  
It's all fun and games,  
'Til someone gets hurt,  
And I don't,  
I won't let that be you  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
There might be something real between us two, who knew?  
Now we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
'Cause I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like Adam and Eve,  
Tragedy was our destiny,  
Like Sunny and Cher,  
I don't care,  
I got you baby  
  
See we both,  
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,  
'Cause ain't no way,  
It's gonna end right but,  
We are both too foolish to stop  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?  
And we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
And I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like,  
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be,  
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,  
And I ain't with it,  
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,  
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,  
But convention's telling us to let go,  
So we'll never know  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
'Cause everything we did,  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do,  
(Nothing my heart can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause, (and space)  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you,  
Yeah,

When the day has come  
But I've lost my way around  
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground  
When the sky turns gray  
And everything is screaming  
I will reach inside  
Just to find my heart is beating  
  
You tell me to hold on  
Oh you tell me to hold on  
But innocence is gone  
And what was right is wrong

And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out

And hopelessness is sinking in  
And the wolves all cry  
To feel they're not worth hollering  
When your eyes are red  
And emptiness is all you know  
With the darkness fed  
I will be your scarecrow  
  
You tell me to hold on  
Oh you tell me to hold on

And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)  
I'm bleeding out for you  
  
'Cause I'm bleeding out  
Said if the last thing that I do  
Is to bring you down  
I'll bleed out for you  
So I peel my skin  
And I count my sins  
And I close my eyes  
And I take it in  
And I'm bleeding out  
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

Imagine Dragons,Cover Up,"There's lights that line these halls  
That beckon us to stay  
A glimmer in the distance  
That gathers all the stray  
And when I need it most  
It breaks into a song  
That runs through all my veins  
And helps me to hold on  
  
It was a long night  
We ran along into the spotlight  
You sang a song that made the children cry  
And all the people knew my name  
It was a bright light  
These lands combine into a great big mass  
We sang along to the very last  
Oh, the jury stole my fame  
And then we grabbed the sun  
And it shined into these eyes  
Believe me  
  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight  
I feel it  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight  
  
Oh, you look so alive  
Did you think that we'd cry tonight?  
Oh, did you think we'd cry?  
Oh, can you feel my heart?  
I think I feel it, too  
Did you think that we'd die tonight?  
Oh, did you think we'd die?  
  
And then we grabbed the sun  
And it shined into these eyes  
Believe me  
  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight  
I feel it  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight  
  
Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove  
Flies it to the places where the silence screams  
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams  
  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight  
I feel it  
Cover up, rain down  
We wept on the edge of this town  
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Imagine Dragons,Friction,"[Verse 1]  
Get down with the victim  
We both know you need them  
You're stuck in the middle  
Of all irrelevance  
And your heart is beating  
Cause you know that you gotta  
Get out of the middle  
And rise to the top now

When you've made it  
Won't ya tell me what to do  
Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction (So ease it off)  
Can't take the pressure (So ease it off)  
Don't tell me to be strong (Ease it off)  
You can't fight the friction  
So, ease it off  
  
[Verse 2]  
And get into the system  
We both know you need one  
The tip of the needle  
Is taking over you  
And your heart is beating  
Cause you know that you gotta  
Get out of the middle  
And rise to the top now

Why can't you let go  
Like a bird in the snow  
This is no place to build your home

You can't fight the friction (So ease it off)  
Can't take the pressure (So ease it off)  
Don't tell me to be strong (Ease it off)  
You can't fight the friction  
So, ease it off

Imagine Dragons,I Bet My Life,"[Verse]  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I know I let you down  
Didn't I?  
  
So many sleepless nights  
Where you were waiting up on me  
Well I'm just a slave  
Unto the night

Now remember when I told you  
That's the last you'll see of me?  
Remember when I broke you  
Down to tears?  
  
I knew I took the path  
That you would never want for me  
I gave you hell through  
All the years

So I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you  
I, I bet my life  
I bet my life, I bet my life for you

I've been around the world  
And never in my wildest dreams  
Would I come  
Running home to you  
  
I've told a million lies,  
but now I tell a single truth  
There's you in  
Everything I do

Now remember when I told you  
That's the last you'll see of me?

Don't tell me that I'm wrong  
I've walked that road before  
And left you on your own  
And please, believe them  
When they say  
  
That it's left for yesterday  
And the records that I play  
Please forgive me for  
All I've done

Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone  
  
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

I could've spoken sooner than I should've  
Only the good die old  
That's what they told me, but I don't know  
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself  
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to  
The things that I've been told  
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

That I believed in to drift away  
ready for the leaves  
I'm ready for the colors to  
burn to gold and crumble away

Always a reason  
Breaking me down to my knees  
In the dead of night  
I keep on praying to see the light  
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself  
Maybe I'm thinking i should just  
keep to the things that I've been told  
wait for the colors to turn to gold

Of all the things that you would change,

So live life like you're giving all

Go on and tell me your path

Even my hand does sometimes  
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light

The only thing you haven't tried

Ed Sheeran,Homeless,"Could I wake up next to you when it's hitting double figures?  
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors  
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur  
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt  
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides  
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time  
Highbury Estate's fine, smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines  
  
Hey, I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my iPod  
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up, driver turn the lights  
Off  
Lights on, on stage, mics on, song plays, nice one  
Gotta keep my hype strong, truth be, never went to Uni  
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see  
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22,  
Done everything I need to, except get a 2:1  
  
I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet

It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
When I feel cold, you keep me warm  
And I'm not looking for some loose change  
Just wanna find a true mate  
Who wants to be my duvet, hey  
  
It's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me

Ed Sheeran,Make It Rain,"[Verse 1]  
When the sins of my father  
Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down, lord  
Make it rain  
Oh, make it rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well, a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound  
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye  
But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The seas are full of water  
Stops by the shore  
It's like the riches of grandeur  
Never reach the poor  
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause  
And let lightning be the veins  
And fill the sky with all that they can draw  
When it's time to make a change  
  
[Chorus x4]

"
Ed Sheeran,Nina,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
Then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now

Waking up, midnight November  
And just still in my bed  
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya  
There's things we've never said  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So if I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's not enough, to say I want ya  
Cause I'll say anything  
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt  
I had have just been questioning it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be  
  
[Bridge]  
All of my bones, they scream I'm right  
If you're taking me home to stay the night  
Darling my soul would heal  
  
[Outro]  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the wrong  
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, how long  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now

And I know my way, is rough and steep  
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me

And I'm going there no more to roam

Used to be you here beside me  
Used to be your arms around me

When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms

Used to be you here beside me  
Is there someone there to reach me?  
Someone there to find me?  
  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
And that's just torture to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Pull yourself into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Got to pull you close into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
Pull yourself right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Wish that you were here beside me  
Wish that your arms were around me  
Your body on my body

They say people go

And though you might be gone, and the world may not know  
Still I see you celestial  
  
Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled  
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple  
  
So how come things move on?  
How come cars don't slow?  
When it feels like the end of my world  
When I should but I can't let you go  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
When I'm cold, cold  
There's a light that you give me  
When I'm in shadow  
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow  
  
Like the brothers in blood, sisters who ride  
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died  
But the changing of winds and the way waters flow  
Life as short as the falling snow  
Now I'm going to miss you, I know  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
In water rolled, salt  
I know that you're with me, and the way you will show  
And you're with me wherever I go  
And you give me this feeling, this everglow  
  
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night  
Until Monday morning feels another life  
I turn the music up  
I'm on a roll this time  
And heaven is in sight  
  
I turn the music up, I got my records on  
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song  
Don't want to see another generation drop  
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop  
  
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees  
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes  
But my heart is beating and my pulses start  
Cathedrals in my heart  
  
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into  
To tell me it's alright  
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony  
And every tear's a waterfall  
Is a waterfall

And I know it's over, a parting of ways

Don't say it was all a waste  
Didn't we have fun?

You disappear

Just a whisper in a puff of smoke  
A secret that nobody knows  
No one will ever hear

A specter on a roller coaster  
A thorn without a rose  
Just something people fear

It's all become clear  
What's the point of feeling love for you  
When you don't believe I'm here?  
What's the point saying ""Rescue me!""  
If no one ever hears?  
Every time I try to pull you close

Inside a glass of water

He asked ""Will I see heaven in mine?""  
  
Oh that is just the way it was,  
And nothing could be better,  
And nothing ever was.

Neither how full nor empty is your glass,  
Cling to the mast  
Spend your whole life living in the past  
Going nowhere fast  
  
So he wrote it on a wall  
The hollowest of halos  
Is no halo at all  
And Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders  
Saying nothing at all  
And you chime  
Stars in heaven align  
Oh

Until my day, my day is done  
And say you'll come and set me free  
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your fire and in your flood

Coldplay,Life In Technicolor II,"There's a wild wind blowing,  
Down the corner of my street  
Every night there the headlights are glowing  
  
There's a cold war coming,  
On the radio I heard  
Baby it's a violent world  
  
Oh love don't let me go  
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow  
I could hear it coming  
I could hear the sirens sound  
Now my feet won't touch the ground  
  
Time came a creepin'  
Oh and time's a loaded gun  
Every road is a ray of light  
It goes on  
Time only can lead you on  
Still it's such a beautiful night  
  
Oh love don't let me go  
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow  
I could hear it coming  
Like a serenade of sound  
Now my feet won't touch the ground  
  
Gravity release me,  
And don't ever hold me down  
Now my feet won't touch the ground.

To share this moonlight  
  
She'll flow down your river  
And ask him and she'll give you

To laugh at how you break  
To melt into this lake

And ask him and she'll give you

Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar

Reflect what I am  
A loser and a winner  
The King of Siam  
And my Siamese twin  
She knows what I'm thinking

She'll flow down your river  
And ask him and she'll give you

Coldplay,Lost Highway,"I'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost  
For a life of sin I have paid the cost  
When I past by all the people say  
Just another guy on the lost highway  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine  
On the day we met, oh I went astray  
I started rolling down that lost highway  
  
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two  
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you  
And now I'm lost, too late to pray  
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway  
  
Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round  
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound  
Take my advice or you'll curse the day  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway

To see what I'm all about  
Keeping my head down  
To see what it feels like now  
But I have no doubt  
One day, we are gonna get out  
  
Tonight maybe we're gonna run  
Dreaming of the Osaka sun  
Ohh ohh...  
Dreaming of when the morning comes

Keeping my head down

One day the sun will come out

The parting of the seas  
But you mean more, mean more to me  
Than any color I can see

But you never looked hard enough  
It's never gonna give itself up  
And all you ever wanted to be  
Living in perfect symmetry  
Nothing is as down or as up  
  
And don't you want to see it come soon  
Floating in a big white balloon  
Or given your own silver spoon  
  
Don't you want to see it come down  
Enough of throwing your arms around  
And saying not a moment too soon

Cause I feel low

That one day we'll be living in the stars  
And I heard it on a tv show  
That somewhere up above  
And in my heart  
They'll be tearing us apart,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
Past the satellites and stars,  
Maybe moving us to mars  
We won't see the earth again  
In these seconds just remain unchanged  
8 to 9, 9 to 10  
We are meeting for the first time  
We might never meet again you and me  
We are meeting for the first time  
Can't you see

Coldplay,O,"A flock of birds hovering above  
Just a flock of birds  
That's how you think of love  
  
And I always  
Look up to the sky  
Pray before the dawn  
Cause they fly always  
Sometimes they arrive  
Sometimes they are gone  
They fly on  
  
A flock of birds hovering above  
Into smoke I'm turned and rise following them up  
  
Still I always  
Look up to the sky, pray before the dawn  
Cause they fly away  
One minute they arrive, next you know they're gone  
  
They fly on  
Fly on  
  
So fly on, ride through  
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you  
Fly on, ride through, maybe one day I can fly with you  
Fly on  
Fly on  
Fly on

Coldplay,Paradise,"When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach  
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of  
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise  
Every time she closed her eyes  
  
When she was just a girl she expected the world  
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth  
Life goes on, it gets so heavy  
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall  
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes  
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly  
  
And dream of para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)  
  
She'd dream of para-para-paradise

And so lying underneath those stormy skies  
She'd say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I know the sun must set to rise""  
  
This could be para-para-paradise  
Para-para-paradise  
  
This could be para-para-paradise

Coldplay,Rainy Day,"Then there was rain  
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray  
At night it was the bright of the moon with me  
Time just floated away  
  
Then there was rain  
The town's foundations were crumbling  
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling  
And time just floated away  
We can watch it and stay and we can listen  
  
Oh, rainy day, come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
And we're separated now  
I'm down  
But I love it when you come over to the house  
I love it when you come over to my house  
  
Then there was rain  
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain  
My lonely little heart would've broke again  
Times were vicious  
  
Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win  
You win but with less than when you begin  
Deeper that the knife goes in  
Oooooooooooooooh  
  
Ooh, rainy day come round  
Sometimes I just want it to slow down  
We're separated now  
I'm down

Coldplay,Streets Of Baltimore,"Well I sold the farm to take my woman  
Where she used to be  
We left our kin and all our friends  
Back there in Tennessee  
And I bought those one way tickets  
She had often begged me for  
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well her heart was filled with gladness  
When she saw those city lights  
She said the prettiest place on earth was  
Baltimore at night  
Well a man feels proud to give his woman  
What she's longing for  
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore  
  
Then I got myself a factory job  
I ran an old machine  
And I bought a little cottage  
In a neighborhood serene  
And every night when I'd come home  
With every muscle sore  
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well I did my best to bring her back  
To what she used to be  
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights  
More than she loved me  
Now I'm a going back on that same train  
That brought me here before  
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

In the future where will I be?  
You can climb a ladder up to the sun  
Or write a song nobody has sung  
Or do something that's never been done  
Or do something that's never been done  
  
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk  
And you feel like you're going where you've been before  
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored  
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk  
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

Coldplay,The Hardest Part,"And the hardest part  
Was letting go, not taking part  
Was the hardest part  
  
And the strangest thing  
Was waiting for that bell to ring  
It was the strangest start  
  
I could feel it go down  
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth  
Silver lining the cloud  
Oh and I  
I wish that I could work it out  
  
And the hardest part  
Was letting go, not taking part  
You really broke my heart  
  
And I tried to sing  
But I couldn't think of anything  
And that was the hardest part  
  
I could feel it go down  
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth  
You're silver lining the clouds  
Oh and I  
Oh and I  
I wonder what it's all about  
I wonder what it's all about  
  
Everything I know is wrong  
Everything I do, it's just comes undone  
And everything is torn apart  
  
Oh and it's the part  
That's the hardest part  
Yeah that's the hardest part  
That's the hardest part

Coldplay,The World Turned Upside Down,"X and why  
The land, sea, rivers, trees  
The stars, the sky  
That and this  
We're part of a bigger plan  
Don't know what it is  
Don't know what it is  
  
You and me  
The land, sun, trees, the sky  
The stars, the sea  
Three hundred and sixty five degrees  
I am the puzzle, you're the missing piece  
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please  
I'll come  
And everything under the sun  
And everything under the sun  
  
What is this feeling that I can't explain?  
And why am I never gonna sleep again?  
What is this thing I've never seen before?  
A little boy lost in a breaking storm  
  
Pilots up, and away they fly  
Some write your name in the summer sky  
Life has really only just begun  
Life, it comes  
And everything under the sun  
  
X is why  
The land, sea, rivers, trees  
The stars, the sky  
Three hundred and sixty five degrees  
All of the surface and the underneath  
Searching the measures in this extra key, ah  
And everything under the sun  
And everything under the sun  
  
What is this feeling that I can't explain?  
And why am I never gonna sleep again?  
What is this thing I've never seen before?  
A little boy lost in a breaking storm  
  
Pilots up, and away they fly  
Some write your name in the summer sky  
Life has really only just begun  
Life, it comes  
And everything under the sun  
  
And you don't know that you've been born  
Can't see the calm until the storm  
Can't tell your right side from your wrong  
Can't see the wave you're riding on...

Coldplay,Things I Don't Understand,"How tides control the sea, and what becomes of me  
How little things can slip out of your hands  
How often people change, no two remain the same  
Why things don't always turn out as you plan  
  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand  
  
I can't, and I can't decide  
Wrong, all my wrong from right  
Day, all my day for night  
Dark, all my dark for light  
I live, but I love this life  
  
How infinite is space, and who decides your fate  
Why everything will dissolve into sand  
How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet  
Why nothing even turns out how you planned  
  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand  
  
I can't, and I can't decide  
Wrong, all my wrong from right  
Day, all my day for night  
Or dark, all my dark for light  
I live, but I love this life

Coldplay,Travis - Why Does It Always Rain On Me?,"I can't sleep tonight  
Everybody saying, ""Everything's alright""  
Still I can't close my eyes  
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights  
  
Sunny days, where have you gone?  
I get the strangest feeling, you belong  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?  
  
Why does it always rain on me?  
Even when the sun is shining  
I can't avoid the lightning  
  
I can't stand myself  
I'm being held up by an invisible man  
Still life on a shelf when  
I got my mind on something else

Coldplay,Trouble,"Oh no I see  
A spider web it's tangled up with me  
And I lost my head  
The thought of all the stupid things I said  
Oh no what's this  
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle  
So I turned to run  
The thought of all the stupid things I've done  
  
And oh I never meant to cause you trouble  
And oh and I never meant to do you wrong  
And oh well if I ever caused you trouble  
Oh no I never meant to do you harm  
  
Oh no I see  
A spider web and it's me in the middle  
So I twist and turn  
Here am I in my little bubble  
  
Singing out  
Oh I never meant to cause you trouble  
Oh I never meant to do you wrong  
Oh well if I ever caused you trouble  
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Coldplay,True Love,"For a second, I was in control  
I had it once, I lost it though  
And all along the fire below would rise  
  
And I wish you could have let me know  
What's really going on below  
I've lost you now, you let me go  
But one last time  
  
Tell me you love me  
If you don't then lie  
Lie to me  
  
Remember once upon a time, when I was  
Yours and you were blind  
The fire would sparkle in your eyes  
And mine  
  
So tell me you love me  
And if you don't then lie, lie to me  
Just tell me you love me  
If you don't then lie, lie to me  
If you don't then lie, lie to me  
  
And call it true call it true love  
Call it true call it true love

Coldplay,Twisted Logic,"Sunlight, opened up my eyes  
To see for the first time  
It opened them up  
And tonight, rivers will run dry  
But not for the first time  
Rivers will run  
  
Hundreds of years in the future  
There could be computers  
Looking for life on Earth  
Don't fight for the wrong side  
Say what you feel like  
Say how you feel  
  
You'll go backwards, but then  
You'll go forwards, again  
You'll go backwards, but then  
You'll go...  
  
Created, then drilled and invaded  
If somebody made it  
Someone will mess it up  
And you are not wrong to  
Ask who does this belong to?  
It belongs to all of us  
  
You'll go backwards, again  
You'll go forwards, again  
You'll go backwards, again  
You'll go forwards...  
  
You'll go backwards, but then  
You'll go forwards, again  
You'll go backwards, but then  
You'll go forwards...

Coldplay,U.F.O.,"Lord I don't know which way I am going  
Which way, the river gonna flow  
It's just seems that upstream, I keep rolling  
Still got such a long way to go  
Still got such a long way to go  
  
Then at last, it's your right, I know, I swear  
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold  
But it's fly, split the sky  
But that's all right, sometimes  
The sunlight comes streaming through the holes.

Coldplay,Up In Flames,"So it's over,  
This time I know it's gone  
Salt water tasted it too long  
I only know I'm wrong  
Now I know it's gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
  
So it's over,  
This time you're flying on  
This time I know no song  
Can stop it slowly burn  
Can stop it slowly gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
  
Up in flames, up in flames  
Up in flames we have slowly gone  
Oh, we have slowly gone  
Can we pour some water on?

Coldplay,Up With The Birds,"The birds they sang, at break of day  
Start again I hear them say  
It's so hard to just walk away  
  
The birds they sang, all a choir  
Start again a little higher  
It's a spark in a sea of gray  
  
The sky is blue dream that lie 'till it's true  
Then taken back the punch I threw  
My arms turn in oh, those clumsy things  
Send me up to that wonderful world  
And then I'm up with the birds  
  
Might have to go  
Where they don't know my name  
Float all over the world  
Just to see her again  
And I won't show or feel any pain  
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain  
  
A simple plot  
But I know one day  
Good things are coming our way  
  
A simple plot  
But I know one day  
Good things are coming our way  
  
Oh, yeah

Coldplay,Us Against The World,"Oh morning come bursting, the clouds amen  
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again  
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in  
In my heart she left a hole  
  
The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties  
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes  
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes  
And the saints go marching in  
  
And sing slow it down  
Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world  
  
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend  
My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den  
And tonight I know it all has to begin again  
So whatever you do, don't let go  
  
And if we could float away  
Fly up to the surface and just start again  
And lift off before trouble  
Just erodes us in the rain  
  
Just erodes us in the rain  
Just erodes us and see roses  
In the rain  
  
Sing slow it down  
Slow it down  
  
Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world  
Through chaos as it swirls  
It's us against the world

Coldplay,Violet Hill,"Was a long and dark December  
From the rooftops I remember  
There was snow  
White snow  
  
Clearly I remember  
From the windows they were watching  
While we froze down below  
  
When the future's architectured  
By a carnival of idiots on show  
You'd better lie low  
  
[Chorus]  
If you love me  
Won't you let me know?  
  
Was a long and dark December  
When the banks became cathedrals  
And the fox  
Became God  
  
Priests clutched onto bibles  
Hollowed out to fit their rifles  
And the cross was held aloft  
  
Bury me in armour  
When I'm dead and hit the ground  
My nerves are poles that unfold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be a soldier  
With the captain of some sinking ship  
Would stow, far below  
  
So if you love me  
Why'd you let me go?  
  
I took my love down to violet hill  
There we sat in snow  
All the time she was silent and still  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
Coldplay,Viva La Vida,"I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning, I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own  
  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never, never an honest word  
That was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Calvary choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know Saint Peter won't call my name  
Never rule this world  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]

I missed the good part, then I realized  
I started looking and the bubble burst  
I started looking for excuses  
Come on in  
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in  
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones  
That I started looking for a warning sign  
  
When the truth is  
I miss you  
Yeah the truth is  
That I miss you so  
  
A warning sign  
It came back to haunt me, and I realized  
That you were an island and I passed you by  
When you were an island to discover  
Come on in  
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in  
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones  
That I started looking for a warning sign  
  
When the truth is

I should not have let you go

That you don't want me there in your life  
  
What if I got it wrong  
And no poem or song  
Could put right what I got wrong  
Or make you feel I belong

That you don't want me there by your side  
That you don't want me there in you life  
  
Oooooooh that's right  
Lets take a breath try to put it aside  
Ooooooh that's right  
How can you know it if you don't even try  
Ooooooh that's right  
  
Every step that you take  
Could be your biggest mistake  
It could bend or it could break  
That's the risk that you take  
  
What if you should decide

That you don't want me there by your side

Tell me ""he had to go""  
  
Said ""I seen you before  
In some kind of dream""  
Seems I've seen you before  
In some kind of a dream

If you ever feel like something's missing  
Things you'll never understand  
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten  
Part of a system plan

All this space I'm taking up  
All this sound is breaking up  
  
Whoa oh

Maybe you'll stumble upon it  
Everything you ever wanted  
In a permanent state  
  
Maybe you'll know when you see it  
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it  
And when you find it you'll keep it  
In a permanent state  
A permanent state  
  
When I was a young boy I tried to listen  
Don't you want to feel like that  
  
You're part of the human race  
All of the stars and the outer space  
Part of the system plan  
  
All this noise, I'm waking up  
All this space I'm taking up

And when you find it you'll keep it  
In a permanent state  
A permanent state  
  
Swimming on a sea of faces  
A tide of the human race  
So, an answer now is what I need  
  
I see it in the new sun rising  
I see it break on your horizon  
Oh come on love, stay with me

Coldplay,Yellow,"Look at the stars  
Look how they shine for you  
And everything you do  
Yeah they were all yellow  
  
I came along  
I wrote a song for you  
And all the things you do  
And it was called yellow  
  
So then I took my turn  
Oh what a thing to have done  
And it was all yellow  
  
Your skin  
Oh yeah your skin and bones  
Turn into something beautiful  
You know you know I love you so  
You know I love you so  
  
I swam across  
I jumped across for you  
Oh what a thing to do  
  
Cause you were all yellow  
I drew a line  
I drew a line for you  
Oh what a thing to do  
And it was all yellow  
  
Your skin  
Oh yeah your skin and bones  
Turn into something beautiful  
And you know  
For you I'd bleed myself dry  
For you I'd bleed myself dry  
  
It's true  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for  
Look how they shine for you  
Look how they shine for you

Coldplay,Yes,"When it started we had high hopes  
Now my back's on the line  
My back's on the ropes  
When it started we were alright  
But night makes a fool of us in daylight  
  
Yeah we were dying of frustration  
Saying ""Lord lead me not into temptation""  
But it's not easy when she turns you on  
Since they gone  
  
If you'll only, if you'd only say yes  
Whether you will's anybody's guess  
God only, God knows I'm trying my best  
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness  
  
So, up they picked me by the big toe  
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go  
There's only screaming  
Let the windows, down  
As I crawl to the ground  
  
If you'll only, if you'd only say yes  
Whether you will's anybody's guess  
God, only God knows she won't let me rest  
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness  
I've become so tired of this loneliness.

"
Coldplay,You Only Live Twice,"You only live twice  
Oh, so it seems  
One life for yourself  
And one for your dreams  
  
You drift through the years  
And life seems stray  
Till one dream appears  
And love is its way  
  
I'd love you to strangers  
Ooh, beckon you on  
Don't think of the danger  
For a stranger is gone  
  
This dream is for you  
So pay the price  
Make one dream come true  
You only live twice  
  
This dream is for you  
So pay the price  
Make one dream come true  
You only live twice  
You only live twice
